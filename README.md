# UnityFastImageRename
I found that it is a tedious process to rename multiple images when it has same name & locate in different folders. 

For a large project . It is possible to have lots of textures with same name but used for different purpose(like particle effect textures).
Sometimes we want to name those image with other unique name. this tool can save sometime for it.

 - Click `Load All Image` first
 - Select Images you want to rename
 - Click `Save` to rename
